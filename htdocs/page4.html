                    <h3>Disadvantages of AI</h3>

                    <p>
                        Nowadays, AI made its way into classrooms as a shortcut for some students. They create papers on any topic
                        in minutes, tempting those near deadlines or struggling with concepts. These programs can recreate writing
                        styles and format citations, making them look real. However, relying on AI for assignments is a
                        disadvantagous choice.


                        Firstly, it rejects the true purpose of education. Assignments are made to enhance students' thinking,
                        research skills, and the ability to explain their understanding of the topics. Skipping these steps with AI
                        leads to a backlash from knowledge and worsens the development of important academic abilities. Students
                        relying on AI become dependent on a machineâ€™s information, missing the chance to study the subject matter
                        and think on their own.
