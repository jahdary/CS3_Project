                    <p>
                        There are benefits for both humans and AI. Repetitive activities can be done by AI with accuracy and speed,
                        and it can handle large amounts of data without getting tired. Because it can see patterns and make predictions
                        that people might overlook, it is extremely useful in fields like finance and medicine.
                    </p>

                    <p>However, people have unique skills of their own. We are more flexible, have more creative thought processes,
                        and are able to understand social relationships and emotions better than artificial intelligence. We have
                        an unrivaled ability to handle difficult situations. It is best to consider AI and humans as a team rather
                        than competitors. Because when AI is able to handle activities that it is good at, humans can concentrate
                        on those that require empathy, creativity, and difficult decision-making. AI and people can collaborate to
                        better tackle challenges together and make the world better.
